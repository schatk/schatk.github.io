# About me

I am a solutions-focused analyst and user experience designer, with extensive experience in Agile/Scrum work environments, information architecture, user research, wire-framing and prototyping, systems analysis, and solution design.

As a graduate from the University of Western Australia, I have a passion for social justice, teaching, research, and providing value to communities, coupled with extensive knowledge of ICT services, particularly in the tertiary education sector.
